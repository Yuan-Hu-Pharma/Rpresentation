**Air quality is very important to people's health. A bad air pollution can damage trees, crops, other plants, lakes, and animals. In addition to damaging the natural environment, air pollution also damages buildings, monuments, and statues. It not only reduces how far you can see in national parks and cities, it even interferes with aviation.**

**Particulate matter, or PM, is the term for particles found in the air, including dust, dirt, soot, smoke, and liquid droplets. Particles can be suspended in the air for long periods of time.**




Air Quality Index (AQI)

Air Quality Level:

```
[1] "Good"                           "Moderate"                      
[3] "Unhealthy"                      "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups"
[5] "Very Unhealthy"                 "Hazardous"                     
```

**The Air Quality Index (AQI), is a uniform system to enable the public to determine whether air quality levels in a particular location are good, moderate, unhealthful, or worse. The AQI includes the PM 2.5.**
